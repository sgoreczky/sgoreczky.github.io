					<h2>Design at Coverity (Acquired by Synopsys)</h2>
					<p>As the lead designer at Coverity (acquired by Synopsys), I am responsible for the design of multiple web-based code static analysis products. I spend most of my time working on information architecture problems and making low-fidelity wireframes. I lead design reviews with the stakeholders and quickly iterate on wireframes in Balsamiq. I communicate solutions across all development, documentation, and product management teams. I use InVision to quickly get feedback and keep our teams aligned.</p>
					<p>For the past year, I've transitioned into working on a SaaS software integrity solution. For the 3 previous years, I worked on an web interface that helps developers understand and triage their static analysis results. As the only UX designer at the company, design work has been spread over a wide range of subjects including: wireframing, prototyping, email design, report design, and data visualizations. Contact me if you'd like to know more about this work.</p>

					<h2>Case Study 1: OpenGov</h2>
					<p>The city of Palo Alto's <a href="https://paloalto.opengov.com/">OpenGov</a> website is a way for citizens to have access to their city's financial data. Task: Design a CSV upload process for city official with a way to map their fields to OpenGov fields. Also design a way for an Admin to check upload requests.</p>
					<p>Assumptions:
						<ul>
							<li>User has signed in.</li>
							<li>There's already an internal landing page where upload link exists.</li>
							<li>In this workflow, person mapping the data and the Admin are two separate users.</li>
							<li>Only CSV files are uploaded.</li>
							<li>The file uploaded in the design has no formatting errors.</li>
							<li>The file uploaded in the design has missing column headers.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Results:</span>
						<ul>
							<li><a target="blank" title="Upload" href="cases/Upload.pdf">Upload workflow.</a> These wireframes go through the CSV upload and field mapping process. These wireframes are interactive and best viewed when downloaded.</li>
							<li><a target="blank" title="Admin Review" href="cases/AdminReview.pdf">Admin Review workflow.</a> After a CSV has been uploaded and mapped, the Admin needs to go in to verify the upload request before it gets pushed into the city dataset.</li>

						<ul>
							<li>Signing in</li>

							<li>Redundant information (red)</li>
							<li>Miscategorized information (purple)</li>
							<li>Advertising to different types of borrowers in different areas (blue)</li>

					<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Results:</span>
						<ul>
							<li><a target="blank" title="MyFedLoan After" href="cases/myfedloan-after.png">Redesigned homepage.</a> The new design highlights the primary use cases for the federal loan payment site. Redundant information has been trimmed and similar information has been grouped.</li>
