			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I am a problem solver that enjoys breaking down barriers and complexity to help people out. I make the complex more accessible by deeply understanding the problem and breaking it down into its simplest form.</p>
			<p>Most recently, I was in charge of UX at Synopsys where I worked to advocate the use of design systems and unified vocabulary to spend more time iterating on the correct user needs, determined by usability testing, instead of getting lost in the pixels. </p>
			<p>My work style involves reading many research papers so we avoid reinventing the wheel. It involves deep collaboration and establishing <a target="blank" title="Harvard Business Review Article on teamwork"href="https://hbr.org/2017/08/high-performing-teams-need-psychological-safety-heres-how-to-create-it">psychological safety</a> between coworkers. I grow, share, and admit to my mistakes with my teammates. If you want a unified user experience, you have to have a unified team working towards a unified goal. I align our direction, make sure assumptions are agreed on, and stick to low fidelity design (paper and Balsamiq) as long as possible. I build Design Systems to set up the unified pattern library and vocabulary UX practioners and developers use. With each iteration, I balance our user (un)spoken needs, business strategy, time to implement, and technical restraints.</p>
			<p>In 2017, I won YWCA Silicon Valley's <a target="blank" title="YouTube video of Sophia talking about the glass ceiling" href="https://youtu.be/PlyEjChTWB8?t=5m11s">Emerging Leader award.</a></p>

			<h2>Portfolio</h2>
			<p>My portfolio is available on request.</p><p>I worked at Synopsys and Coverity (Prior to being acquired by Synopsys) for 8 years because someone needed to make sure the world is a safer place with better software. I started out working with software static analysis but got to know more about software composition analysis (SCA) and fuzzing.</p>
			<p>I've coded up this site on my own. I believe it's important to understand the medium you work with.</p>
