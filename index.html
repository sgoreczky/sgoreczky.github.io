				<h2>Me</h2>
				<p>My design philosophy always starts with a well-defined problem.</p>
				<p>As a user experience designer, I spend a majority of my time solving high volume data problems to create a UI that is informative without being overwhelming. I focus on functionality challenges while still creating an aesthetically pleasing product.</p>
				<p>I think like a programmer but empathize with the people using my products. I make it a priority to advocate for their needs. My designs address these needs while remaining within the technical limitations of the project.</p>
				<p>I tend to talk about space, robots, and data a lot.</p>

				<h2>Education</h2>
				<p>I graduated from Cornell's Engineering school with an independent major
				focusing on Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction. I was a member of
				two engineering project teams: Cornell Minesweeper and Cornell Mars Rover.</p>

					<h2>Work</h2>
					<p>
					I work at <a href="http://www.coverity.com/products/" target="blank">Coverity (Acquired by Synopsys)</a>. We help people find bugs in their code via static analysis and I
					design the products that help them figure out what to do next. At Coverity, our goal is to help people catch and fix bugs in their code during the development cycle.
					</p>
					<p>
					Over the past year, I have transitioned to working on a SaaS software integrity solution. Previously, I spent a majority of three years working on the Coverity Connect UI. Connect is the UI for our static analysis results. Users get a list of issues found in their code base
					and can view the related source code to understand why those issues are a problem to begin with. These issues can then be triaged so that a developer can resolve the problem.
