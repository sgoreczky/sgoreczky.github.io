			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I am a problem solver that enjoys breaking down barriers and complexity to help people out. I make the complex accessible by deeply understanding the problem and breaking it down into its simplest form.</p>
			<p>I spent some time during Cornell building <a target="blank" title="Sophia's rapid prototying YouTube channel" href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBCDBE046332CBE70">robots</a> and gained my public speaking skills from presenting my science fair projects (2006 and 2007 International Science Fair 3rd and 4th place winner in Electrical Engineering, respectively).</p>
			<p>My work style involves reading many research papers so we avoid reinventing the wheel. It involves deep collaboration and establishing <a target="blank" title="Harvard Business Review Article on teamwork"href="https://hbr.org/2017/08/high-performing-teams-need-psychological-safety-heres-how-to-create-it">psychological safety</a> between coworkers. I grow, share, and admit to my mistakes with my teammates. If you want a unified user experience, you have to have a unified team working towards a unified goal. I align our direction, make sure assumptions are agreed on, and stick to low fidelity design (paper and Balsamiq) as long as possible. I build Design Systems to set up the unified pattern library and vocabulary UX practioners and developers use. With each iteration, I balance our user (un)spoken needs, business strategy, time to implement, and technical restraints.</p>
			<p>In 2017, I won YWCA Silicon Valley's <a target="blank" title="YouTube video of Sophia talking about the glass ceiling" href="https://youtu.be/PlyEjChTWB8?t=5m11s">Emerging Leader award.</a></p>

			<h2>Portfolio</h2>
			<p>I worked at Synopsys and Coverity (Prior to being acquired by Synopsys) for 8 years because someone needed to make sure the world is a safer place with better software. I started out working with software static analysis but have now gotten to know more about software composition analysis (SCA) and fuzzing. I wish I could share all the work I've done to unify all these different aspects of software quality and security but it is not public.</p>
			<p>I've coded up this site on my own. I believe it's important to understand the medium you work with.</p>
